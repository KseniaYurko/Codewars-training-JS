This repo contains tasks of varying complexity from the Codewars site :)

## Fundamentals  
Tasks for training the basics of language. Most of them solved in one line)

## Runk Up  
More complex tasks amied at training algorithms.

<p>

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is `"("` if that character appears only once in the original string, or `")"` if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

**Examples**

```javascript
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 
```

**Notes**  
Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!
